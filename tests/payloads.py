"""Sample PostNL payloads shared by the test modules.

Covers both sides of the fork: the raw GraphQL/track & trace shapes the API
returns, and the normalised letter dict the letters pipeline hands to the image
platform. Keep them here rather than inline in each test module: when a shape
turns out to differ from what we assumed, there is then exactly one place to
fix — ``letter_sample`` in particular was previously duplicated between the
coordinator and image tests.

Every helper returns a **fresh** dict, so a test may mutate what it gets back
without leaking into the next one.
